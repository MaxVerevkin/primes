`main.c` - prime number generator. To compile use `make`. Run with `./primes <N>`, where N - the greatest prime number, does not have to be prime.

`plot.py` - this is a plotting script. It takes file of sorted prime numbers on each line (name of the file could be easily changed in the code) and produces `primes.svg` - The final plot. You man need to adjust the size of the polt. The plot itsef is a continuous line, that makes a 90 degree turn right every time it's length becomes a prime number. 90 degrees can also be easily changed.
